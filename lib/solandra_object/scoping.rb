      # Adds a class method for retrieving and querying objects. A \scope represents a narrowing of a SOLR query,
      # such as <tt>where(:color => :red).order(:size)</tt>.
      #
      #   class Shirt < SolandraObject::Base
      #     scope :red, where(:color => 'red')
      #     scope :dry_clean_only, where(:dry_clean => true)
      #   end
      #
      # The above calls to <tt>scope</tt> define class methods Shirt.red and Shirt.dry_clean_only. Shirt.red,
      # in effect, represents the query <tt>Shirt.where(:color => 'red')</tt>.
      #
      # Note that this is simply 'syntactic sugar' for defining an actual class method:
      #
      #   class Shirt < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     def self.red
      #       where(:color => 'red')
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # Unlike <tt>Shirt.find(...)</tt>, however, the object returned by Shirt.red is not an Array; it
      # resembles the association object constructed by a <tt>has_many</tt> declaration. For instance,
      # you can invoke <tt>Shirt.red.first</tt>, <tt>Shirt.red.count</tt>, <tt>Shirt.red.where(:size => 'small')</tt>.
      # Also, just as with the association objects, named \scopes act like an Array, implementing Enumerable;
      # <tt>Shirt.red.each(&block)</tt>, <tt>Shirt.red.first</tt>, and <tt>Shirt.red.inject(memo, &block)</tt>
      # all behave as if Shirt.red really was an Array.
      #
      # These named \scopes are composable. For instance, <tt>Shirt.red.dry_clean_only</tt> will produce
      # all shirts that are both red and dry clean only.
      # Nested finds and calculations also work with these compositions: <tt>Shirt.red.dry_clean_only.count</tt>
      # returns the number of garments for which these criteria obtain. Similarly with
      # <tt>Shirt.red.dry_clean_only.average(:thread_count)</tt>.
      #
      # All \scopes are available as class methods on the SolandraObject::Base descendant upon which
      # the \scopes were defined. But they are also available to <tt>has_many</tt> associations. If,
      #
      #   class Person < SolandraObject::Base
      #     has_many :shirts
      #   end
      #
      # then <tt>elton.shirts.red.dry_clean_only</tt> will return all of Elton's red, dry clean
      # only shirts.
      #
      # Named \scopes can also be procedural:
      #
      #   class Shirt < SolandraObject::Base
      #     scope :colored, lambda { |color| where(:color => color) }
      #   end
      #
      # In this example, <tt>Shirt.colored('puce')</tt> finds all puce shirts.
      #
      # Note that scopes defined with \scope will be evaluated when they are defined, rather than
      # when they are used. For example, the following would be incorrect:
      #
      #   class Post < SolandraObject::Base
      #     scope :recent, where('published_at >= ?', Time.current - 1.week)
      #   end
      #
      # The example above would be 'frozen' to the <tt>Time.current</tt> value when the <tt>Post</tt>
      # class was defined, and so the resultant SOLR query would always be the same. The correct
      # way to do this would be via a lambda, which will re-evaluate the scope each time
      # it is called:
      #
      #   class Post < SolandraObject::Base
      #     scope :recent, lambda { where('published_at >= ?', Time.current - 1.week) }
      #   end
      #
      # Named \scopes can also have extensions, just as with <tt>has_many</tt> declarations:
      #
      #   class Shirt < SolandraObject::Base
      #     scope :red, where(:color => 'red') do
      #       def dom_id
      #         'red_shirts'
      #       end
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # Scopes can also be used while creating/building a record.
      #
      #   class Article < SolandraObject::Base
      #     scope :published, where(:published => true)
      #   end
      #

      # Class methods on your model are automatically available
      # on scopes. Assuming the following setup:

      #   class Article < SolandraObject::Base
