module SolandraObject #:nodoc:
  # = Solandra Object
  #
  # Solandra Object-based objects differ from Active Record objects in that they specify their
  # attributes directly on the model.  This is necessary because of the fact that Cassandra
  # column families do not have a set list of columns but rather can have different columns per
  # row.  By specifying the attributes on the model, getters and setters are automatically
  # created, and the attribute is automatically indexed into SOLR.
  #
  # == Creation
  #
  # Solandra Objects accept constructor parameters either in a hash or as a block. The hash
  # method is especially useful when you're receiving the data from somewhere else, like an
  # HTTP request. It works like this:
  #
  #   user = User.new(:name => "David", :occupation => "Code Artist")
  #   user.name # => "David"
  #
  # You can also use block initialization:
  #
  #   user = User.new do |u|
  #     u.name = "David"
  #     u.occupation = "Code Artist"
  #   end
  #
  # And of course you can just create a bare object and specify the attributes after the fact:
  #
  #   user = User.new
  #   user.name = "David"
  #   user.occupation = "Code Artist"
  #
  # == Conditions
  #
  # Conditions are specified as a hash representing key/value pairs that will eventually be passed to Sunspot or as
  # a chained call for greater_than and less_than conditions.  In addition, fulltext queries may be specified as a
  # string that will eventually be parsed by SOLR as a standard SOLR query.
  #
  # A simple hash without a statement will generate conditions based on equality using boolean AND logic.
  # For instance:
  #
  #   Student.where(:first_name => "Harvey", :status => 1)
  #   Student.where(params[:student])
  #
  # A range may be used in the hash to use a SOLR range query:
  #
  #   Student.where(:grade => 9..12)
  #
  # An array may be used in the hash to construct a SOLR OR query:
  #
  #   Student.where(:grade => [9,11,12])
  #
  # Inequality can be tested for like so:
  #
  #   Student.where_not(:grade => 9)
  #   Student.where(:grade).greater_than(9)
  #   Student.where(:grade).less_than(10)
  #
  # Fulltext searching is natively supported.  All text and string fields are automatically indexed for fulltext
  # searching.
  #
  #   Post.fulltext('Apple AND "iPhone 4s"')
  #
  # Fulltext searching uses the standard Lucene query parser.  If you want to use the newer disMax query parser,
  # you can specify it like so:
  #
  #   Post.fulltext('Apple iPhone 4s').query_parser('disMax')
  #
  # For a full discussion of the differences between the two query parsers, see the SOLR documentation:
  # https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrQuerySyntax
  #
  # == Overwriting default accessors
  #
  # All column values are automatically available through basic accessors on the Solandra Object,
  # but sometimes you want to specialize this behavior. This can be done by overwriting
  # the default accessors (using the same name as the attribute) and calling
  # <tt>read_attribute(attr_name)</tt> and <tt>write_attribute(attr_name, value)</tt> to actually
  # change things.
  #
  #   class Song < SolandraObject::Base
  #     # Uses an integer of seconds to hold the length of the song
  #
  #     def length=(minutes)
  #       write_attribute(:length, minutes.to_i * 60)
  #     end
  #
  #     def length
  #       read_attribute(:length) / 60
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # You can alternatively use <tt>self[:attribute]=(value)</tt> and <tt>self[:attribute]</tt>
  # instead of <tt>write_attribute(:attribute, value)</tt> and <tt>read_attribute(:attribute)</tt>.
  #
  # == Dynamic attribute-based finders
  #
  # Dynamic attribute-based finders are a cleaner way of getting (and/or creating) objects
  # by simple queries without using where chains. They work by appending the name of an attribute
  # to <tt>find_by_</tt> or <tt>find_all_by_</tt> and thus produces finders
  # like <tt>Person.find_by_user_name</tt>, <tt>Person.find_all_by_last_name</tt>, and
  # <tt>Payment.find_by_transaction_id</tt>. Instead of writing
  # <tt>Person.where(:user_name => user_name).first</tt>, you just do <tt>Person.find_by_user_name(user_name)</tt>.
  # And instead of writing <tt>Person.where(:last_name => last_name).all</tt>, you just do
  # <tt>Person.find_all_by_last_name(last_name)</tt>.
  #
  # It's also possible to use multiple attributes in the same find by separating them with "_and_".
  #
  #   Person.where(:user_name => user_name, :password => password).first
  #   Person.find_by_user_name_and_password(user_name, password) # with dynamic finder
  #
  # It's even possible to call these dynamic finder methods on relations and named scopes.
  #
  #   Payment.order("created_on").find_all_by_amount(50)
  #   Payment.pending.find_last_by_amount(100)
  #
  # The same dynamic finder style can be used to create the object if it doesn't already exist.
  # This dynamic finder is called with <tt>find_or_create_by_</tt> and will return the object if
  # it already exists and otherwise creates it, then returns it. Protected attributes won't be set
  # unless they are given in a block.
  #
  # NOTE: This functionality is currently unimplemented but will be in a release in the near future.
  #
  #   # No 'Summer' tag exists
  #   Tag.find_or_create_by_name("Summer") # equal to Tag.create(:name => "Summer")
  #
  #   # Now the 'Summer' tag does exist
  #   Tag.find_or_create_by_name("Summer") # equal to Tag.find_by_name("Summer")
  #
  #   # Now 'Bob' exist and is an 'admin'
  #   User.find_or_create_by_name('Bob', :age => 40) { |u| u.admin = true }
  #
  # Use the <tt>find_or_initialize_by_</tt> finder if you want to return a new record without
  # saving it first. Protected attributes won't be set unless they are given in a block.
  #
  #   # No 'Winter' tag exists
  #   winter = Tag.find_or_initialize_by_name("Winter")
  #   winter.persisted? # false
  #
  # Just like <tt>find_by_*</tt>, you can also use <tt>scoped_by_*</tt> to retrieve data. The good thing about
  # using this feature is that the very first time result is returned using <tt>method_missing</tt> technique
  # but after that the method is declared on the class. Henceforth <tt>method_missing</tt> will not be hit.
  #
  #   User.scoped_by_user_name('David')
  #
  # == Exceptions
  #
  # * SolandraObjectError - Generic error class and superclass of all other errors raised by Solandra Object.
  # * AssociationTypeMismatch - The object assigned to the association wasn't of the type
  #   specified in the association definition.
  # * ConnectionNotEstablished+ - No connection has been established. Use <tt>establish_connection</tt>
  #   before querying.
  # * RecordNotFound - No record responded to the +find+ method. Either the row with the given ID doesn't exist
  #   or the row didn't meet the additional restrictions. Some +find+ calls do not raise this exception to signal
  #   nothing was found, please check its documentation for further details.
  # * MultiparameterAssignmentErrors - Collection of errors that occurred during a mass assignment using the
  #   <tt>attributes=</tt> method. The +errors+ property of this exception contains an array of
  #   AttributeAssignmentError objects that should be inspected to determine which attributes triggered the errors.
  # * AttributeAssignmentError - An error occurred while doing a mass assignment through the
  #   <tt>attributes=</tt> method.
  #   You can inspect the +attribute+ property of the exception object to determine which attribute
  #   triggered the error.
  #
